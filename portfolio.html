<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
  In a nutshell, I’m a passionate software developer. I aspire to make 
  softwares that serve people and make their life better. This is one major 
  reason I’m dedicated towards web applications because web browser is the most 
  prevalent and accessible platform in the world. Specializing in this field
  allows my code to be reached by the most.
</p>
<p>
  I finished my undergrad degree in December, 2020 and I studied cell and molecular 
  biology, interned at SickKids doing paediatric brain tumour research for a year. 
  I wanted to pursue medicine but it turned out I’m more of an engineer person 
  rather than a scientist. So I digressed, took on programming as a hobby at 
  first, but later became so committed to it that by the time I graduated, 
  I decided to pursue a career in the field.

<p>
  I believe at the core of software is humanity and the hallmark of humanity is 
  written communication. I hope this blog would document my journey as an 
  engineer and growth as a person.
